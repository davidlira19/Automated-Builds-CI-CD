## Introduction

On this research I am going to talk about Automated Builds with Continous Integration and Continous Deployment, I will explain the basics concepts of this topic, how to implement it on your repositories and the different uses that we can give to them.

## Automated Builds

Build automation is the process of automating the retrieval of source code, compiling it into binary code, executing automated tests, and publishing it into a shared, centralized repository.

Build automation is a critical first step of any CI/CD process. You must have build automation in place in order for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continous Deployment (CD) to occur.

Automated Builds advantages:
- A necessary pre-condition for continuous integration and continuous testing
- Improve product quality
- Accelerate the compile and link processing
- Eliminate redundant tasks
- Minimize "bad builds"
- Eliminate dependencies on key personnel
- Have history of builds and releases in order to investigate issues
- Save time and money - because of the reasons listed above.

We can find different types of automation softwares for different code languages that can be applied on Github Actions (what we will talk about later), there are some examples:

### Continous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy. Developers continually commit code in small increments, which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.

Continous integration benefits:
- Improve team productivity and efficiency
- Accelerate speed to market
- Identify product/market fit
- Release higher quality, more stable products
- Increase customer satisfaction
- Keep developers happy and shipping code


### Continous Deployment (CD)

Continuous deployment is the methodology of creating a robust testing framework and automatically pushing your code out when tests pass.

Continuous deployment also encourages other kinds of continuous action, like analytics, error reporting, and testing.
